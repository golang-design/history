# [Go: A Documentary](https://golang.design/history)

_by Changkun Ou <[changkun.de](https://changkun.de)>_ (and many inputs from [contributors](https://github.com/golang-design/history/graphs/contributors))

This document collects many interesting (publicly observable) issues,
discussions, proposals, CLs, and talks from the Go development process,
which intends to offer a comprehensive reference of the Go history.

## Origin

Go is a big project driven by a tiny group of people and the crowd of
wisdom from the language user community. Here are some core committers
to the project if you are interested in following their excellent work.

Go's origin is attractive without doubts. By listening to the talks held
by these people, you could learn more about their oral history and fun
stories behind the great work.

For instance, here are some exciting talks regarding the historical feats
in Go might be your starting points (as a _subjective_ recommendation):
`talk/rob2007`, `talk/rob2009`, `talk/rob2010b`, `talk/rob2010d`,
`talk/rob2011a`, `talk/rob2013a`, `talk/rob2019`, `talk/robert2015`,
`talk/russ2014`, `steve2019b`, etc.

## Committers

### Core Authors

The Go language was created by Rob, Robert, and Ken initially because
Rob was bothered by slow C++ compiling times, talked to Robert, and luckily
Ken was in the next office.
Later, Ian joined the project after showing interest, and
wrote the [gccgo](https://github.com/golang/gofrontend).
Rob and Ken are retired. Robert and Ian currently work on adding generics
to Go. Russ is also one of the core authors of the project in the early stage.
Back then, he was a newcomer at Google, and Rob invited Russ for joining
the Go team since he knew Russ from way back because of the
[Plan 9](https://9p.io/plan9/) project. Russ worked on the early Go compiler, runtime, as well as the leap of
Go 1.5 bootstrap.
Now, Russ is the tech leader of the Go team.

### Compiler/Runtime Team

Dmitry is not from the Go team but on the dynamic testing tools team from Google.
He wrote the scalable goroutine scheduler, many other performance improvements,
synchronization primitives, race detector, and blocking profiler that
related to the Go runtime.
Austin was an intern at Google who worked on the Go project in the early days
while pursuing a Ph. D. Later, he joined the Go team after his academic career
and work together with Rick for the Go's concurrent GC. He also worked on
the current preemptive scheduler and linker.
Now, he is leading the Compiler/Runtime team for Go.
Keith and David together focus on the Go's compiler backend,
notably the current SSA backend. Michael is a recent newcomer to the Go team,
his work is mainly in the runtime memory system such as the refactoring of memory allocator and runtime metrics.

### Error values 

Error handling includes two separate works: error values and error formatting. Historically, there was a try proposal that had been investigated for a year, however, due to its lack of simplicity and impact to stack tracing, it was rejected. In 1.13, error values received a large revision, and the package `errors` includes different APIs, such as `errors.Is`. Until recently (1.21), #53435 allows wrapping multiple errors, and there is a community repository that tries to implement the original try proposal.

### Linker

The Go Linker was written by Ken Thompson. Russ led a few more overhaul in Go 1.3. Austin led a rework to the linker together with Keith, Than,
Cheery and many other brilliant brains, which was landed
in Go 1.15 and Go 1.16.

### Memory Management

#### Allocator

A quick history about the Go's memory allocator: Russ Cox first implements
the memory allocator based on `tcmalloc` for Go 1, `mcache` is cached on M.
Then he revised the allocator to allow user code to use 16GB memory and later allows 128GB.
However, the allocator (including scavenger) was suffered from massive lock contentions and
does not scale. After Dmitry's scalable runtime scheduler, the allocator can allocate directly
from P (with much less) lock contentions. In the meantime, the scavenger is migrated from
an independent thread into the system monitor thread. Now, Michael is actively working on
improving the memory allocator's scalability, such as migrating scavenger
to user threads, bitmap-based page allocator, scalable mcentral.

### image, x/image

The following issues are surrounding by the color management of the `image` standard library.
At the moment, Go's `image` library doesn't read or write meta information from an image in
the encoding or decoding phase. Therefore the color information could go wrong while processing
an image such as scaling in a non-linear sRGB space. A universal solution is to design image
metadata APIs to aware the color profile in an encoded image file.
