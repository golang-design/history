### Core Authors

The Go language was created by Rob, Robert, and Ken initially because
Rob was bothered by slow C++ compiling times, talked to Robert, and luckily
Ken was in the next office.
Later, Ian joined the project after showing interest, and
wrote the [gccgo](https://github.com/golang/gofrontend).
Rob and Ken are retired. Robert and Ian currently work on adding generics
to Go. Russ is also one of the core authors of the project in the early stage.
Back then, he was a newcomer at Google, and Rob invited Russ for joining
the Go team since he knew Russ from way back because of the
[Plan 9](https://9p.io/plan9/) project. Russ worked on the early Go compiler, runtime, as well as the leap of
Go 1.5 bootstrap.
Now, Russ is the tech leader of the Go team.

    <p><b>Summary:</b>In this Google Tech Talk from May 2007, Rob Pike, creator of UTF-8 and Plan 9 for Bell Labs, discusses his programming language, New Squeak, which features interesting mechanisms for concurrency and message passing. Pike argues that there are two ways to deal with the mismatch between the concurrent world we live in and the sequential computers we use to write programs: make the world look synchronous and sequential, or make software concurrent. Pike discusses the limitations of low-level concepts like threads, shared memory, and locks when it comes to programming for concurrency. New Squeak is a programming language that was created in 1988 to address issues that arise when writing software for a concurrent world. It has lambdas as functions, process management software, and channels as first-class citizens. The language inspired other languages and was used as a systems language at Bell Labs for a few years to build interesting tools. The talk focuses on processes and channels in New Squeak and how to write programs using these concepts. Channels are a communication tool used in programming that reduce the number of tokens needed for communication. Channels in CSP are introduced by the keyword Chan in New Squeak and are unbuffered synchronous communication ports that synchronize and communicate values between processes. New Squeak's channels and select statements enable potential communications and allow processes to block until one or more communications can proceed. The article introduces a simple language with n-way muxing and presents a program that prints sequential integers to a channel. It also explains the concept of a prime sieve and filter process to find all the primes that come out of a calculation. The system can also be used to manipulate power series. The article discusses the use of interfaces and channels in programming, with an example from the Newspeak language. The author discusses a system model used in building window systems in Plan Nine, which involves defining components as interfaces that capture communication and data flow through channels. This approach was used in all major user-level services in Plan Nine and was made easier by the author's previous experience with concurrency models in programming. The model allows for complex interactions between components and allows for composing interfaces themselves, rather than just state machines. The author also discusses the challenges of debugging concurrent programs and the limitations of CSP-like libraries for implementing select operations. They propose the idea of a shim interface that guarantees deadlock-free operation and can isolate and kill misbehaving clients. The Squint interpreter, a code from 1988, lacks many libraries for graphics and other functions. The idea of implementing a communication channel model on top of mutexes in C++ is discussed, and the cost of a channel versus a callback is debated. Optimizations can be made to generate more compact code for different forms of select.</p>

    <p><b>Summary:</b> In the video episode titled "Rob Pike. Origins of Go Concurrency Style, " Rob Pike discusses the origins and concepts of concurrency in the Go programming language. He highlights the influence of Tony Hoare's paper on communicating sequential processes (CSP) in 1978, which emphasized communication and parallel composition of sequential processes. Pike describes CSP as a mathematical and elegant language that focuses on communication and synchronization between sender and receiver. Pike explains how processes can be combined in parallel, resembling a pipeline, and mentions the limitations of CSP, such as the inability to dynamically create processes or use send as a guard, and the lack of support for threads or mutexes. He also discusses the development of concurrent programming models and the emergence of the Occam language, which laid out the foundations for programming multi-processors and concurrent algorithms without the need for locks. The video episode also touches on the development of the Limbo language into Go, highlighting the power of Go's CSP model and its use of channels for communication and concurrency. Channels are described as first-class values that enable the transmission of data and capabilities between processes. Pike mentions the development of the lf language, which faced challenges due to its lack of garbage collection, but Limbo addressed these issues and became more successful in its limited domain. The benefits of using concurrency in programming are discussed, particularly in the context of the CSP model. Pike emphasizes how concurrency allows for efficient computation in areas such as cryptography and graphics, while also providing the opportunity for code reusability. He recommends reading the original CSP paper for a deeper understanding of the language and discusses the concepts of process control and communication, emphasizing the importance of understanding the power of co-routines. Pike also highlights the ease and safety of writing concurrent programs in Go, emphasizing that Go's concurrency features are natural and easy to use. He mentions the safety of Go's memory system and type safety, cautioning against using the unsafe package. The language has been successfully used in various applications, including high-traffic websites, and offers powerful channel capabilities for communication. The video episode concludes by explaining the concept of channels in a systems language, where types determine what can be sent through a channel. It discusses the efficiency and flexibility of this approach compared to traditional sharing and locking models. Pike also mentions the concept of passing pointers in programming and how it relates to efficiency and ownership, emphasizing the importance of understanding that once a pointer is passed, it is no longer the concern of the original owner. The episode highlights the idea that making things easy can lead to increased efficiency, which is seen as a positive point.</p></details>

    <p><b>Summary:</b>In the opening keynote of GopherConSG 2018, Russ Cox discusses the need for package versioning in the Go programming language. He emphasizes the challenges faced by developers due to incompatible versions and broken builds. Currently, Go lacks awareness of package versions, making it difficult to create version-aware tools. Cox proposes adding package versions directly to Go through a new import path syntax and version selection algorithm. He highlights the principles of compatibility, repeatability, and cooperation in software engineering. Compatibility ensures that the meaning of a name in a program remains consistent over time, simplifying development and maintenance. However, semantic versioning, which encourages incompatibility between software versions, is seen as a drawback. To address compatibility issues, Cox suggests using semantic import versioning, where different major versions use different import paths. Import paths in Go simplify software engineering by eliminating ambiguity. Upgrading to different versions of a module may require changing import paths, but tools like global search and replace and go fix can make this process easier. Import paths allow for gradual updates and clear identification of converted code, while semantic versioning helps avoid conflicts and diamond dependency problems. The text also explores the concepts of import versioning and repeatability in software development. It discusses the challenges faced by different versioning systems and the importance of considering these principles in software engineering. Repeatability is crucial in dependency management systems to ensure bug fixes and security updates during deployment. The balance between the latest dependencies and repeatability in library builds is emphasized. Cooperation is highlighted as essential in the NGO open-source ecosystem. Collaboration between authors is necessary to address compatibility issues and release fixes and updates. Without cooperation, the ecosystem is at risk of failure. In conclusion, Cox emphasizes the importance of versioning in the Go toolchain and ecosystem. He encourages developers to try out the new version support in Go 1. 11 and provide feedback. By implementing package versioning, Go can address compatibility issues, ensure repeatability in builds, and foster a healthy and thriving open-source ecosystem.</p></details>

    <p><b>Summary:</b>In the video episode titled "GothamGo 2016 Codebase Refactoring (with help from Go)" by Russ Cox, the challenges of working with large code bases in Go and the importance of scalability are discussed. Cox, who has been involved in the development of the Go Programming Language since its early stages, shares his insights on how Go can better assist in the refactoring of code package structures. The episode begins by highlighting the challenges faced when dealing with large code bases, such as Google's single repository, and emphasizes the need for efficient imports and minimizing unnecessary dependencies. Cox explains the reasons for splitting code into separate packages, which include improving manageability and reducing dependencies. Cox then discusses the process of codebase refactoring, suggesting breaking it down into three stages: making preliminary changes, updating the code to use the new API, and removing the old API. This gradual approach allows for easier review and submission of smaller commits, especially when dealing with code spread across multiple repositories. The video also delves into the challenges of achieving interchangeability in Go programming. While functions and types can be defined as interchangeable, moving a type from one package to another poses limitations. Cox mentions a solution implemented in 2011 but suggests it may not be ideal. He also highlights the difficulties faced in the Kubernetes project when moving types in a codebase. Cox proposes the addition of a mechanism to create interchangeable names for types and emphasizes the need for Go to support gradual code repair for moving types between packages. He expresses gratitude for input on the matter and mentions that the inclusion of type aliases is being reevaluated to determine the appropriate course of action. Overall, the podcast provides valuable insights into the challenges of working with large code bases in Go and offers suggestions for improving codebase refactoring and achieving interchangeability.</p></details>

### Error values

Error handling includes two separate works: error values and error formatting. Historically, there was a try proposal that had been investigated for a year, however, due to its lack of simplicity and impact to stack tracing, it was rejected. In 1.13, error values received a large revision, and the package `errors` includes different APIs, such as `errors.Is`. Until recently (1.21), #53435 allows wrapping multiple errors, and there is a community repository that tries to implement the original try proposal.

    <p><b>Summary:</b>The Go team at Google recently held an open meeting to discuss various topics related to the Go programming language. One of the main concerns raised was the issue of Windows ownership and the perceived neglect of the platform. Microsoft has acknowledged the need for improvement and plans to enhance the integration of Windows and interaction with Windows Tools. Increased community ownership is also seen as beneficial. Another topic of discussion was the potential usefulness of the new standard Library package called Arenas. While Arenas are being used at Google for data serialization and deserialization, there are concerns about manual memory release. Specific feedback is needed to improve the proposed API and address issues like controlling chunk size. The importance of investing in RAM efficiency and reducing memory footprint was emphasized, along with exploring methods to automatically free resources more efficiently. The meeting also touched on the performance trade-offs and impact on different platforms, particularly in atomic reads. A prototype of a Swiss table implementation is being developed, with ongoing discussions and issue tracking. The team is seeking feedback on the benchmarks they are running and their representativeness. Other topics discussed include understanding stack growth and frame pointers in binaries for different architectures, the importance of PDB files for efficient Windows debugging, and the limitations and scalability issues with PGO (Profile-Guided Optimization). The inliner has undergone changes with the implementation of unified IR, removing limitations and enhancing inlining. The team is also exploring ways to integrate inlining and escape analysis into SSA (Static Single Assignment) and improve the computation and usage of hairiness. The meeting concluded with appreciation for the participants, and the next meeting is scheduled for a month later. Overall, the meeting covered a range of topics related to the Go compiler and runtime, addressing concerns, seeking feedback, and discussing potential improvements and optimizations.</p></details>

    <p><b>Summary:</b>In the Go compiler and runtime office hours on January 19, 2023, several key topics were discussed. The focus was on reducing binary sizes and identifying dead code in large programs with dependencies. The current method of using 'go mode vendor' and grep for reflection was considered hacky, and the author suggested that the Linker could provide more detailed information on the function triggering dead code behavior. Reflection abuse in dependency trees can be managed by using a method by name with variable strings and analyzing the entire dependency tree using a reachability graph. The discussion also touched on the challenges faced in debugging on Plan 9 due to infrastructure issues and lack of support for runtime changes. The adoption of the New Port policy has helped reduce this problem. Plan 9's unique memory manager poses compatibility issues with other architectures, and manipulating page tables is a challenge. The system's memory management provides efficient allocation but has limited availability of support. In terms of performance optimization, periodic reloading of data in the live Heap slows down request processing, and garbage collection cycles further slow down go routines. However, scaling the cluster is costly, and optimization efforts can eliminate tail latency. The use of a user space pacer to predict the start of the collection cycle improves CPU time efficiency. Finalizers and background processes schedule and make decisions during garbage collection cycles. Monitoring the live Heap and adjusting trigger points based on its trend is crucial for optimizing performance. Improving communication and support within the Plan 9 community was also highlighted, as well as the process for adding new members to the group. The need for updates in certain apps and understanding the process of updating Go versions was emphasized. Scheduling future discussions on these topics was recommended. Overall, the office hours provided valuable insights into various aspects of the Go compiler and runtime. The discussions focused on reducing binary sizes, identifying dead code, debugging challenges on Plan 9, performance optimization, and improving communication within the community. The experts acknowledged the challenges and committed to finding solutions through open communication and collaboration.</p></details>

    <p><b>Summary:</b>In this episode, Chris Manghane from the core Go language team at Google provides a brief overview of gccgo, also known as "the other Go compiler. " Gccgo is a Go compiler that utilizes the power of GCC for compilation and optimization. It was written by Ian Lance Taylor and released in November 2009, and it is still actively maintained by him. Manghane explains that the decision to develop gccgo using C++ and targeting GCC was made because GCC supports a wide range of architectures and offers extensive capabilities in code analysis, optimization, and generation. By using GCC as a compiler, technical honesty is promoted, as it avoids dependence on a single implementation. Additionally, having multiple implementations of a product helps identify flaws and improve designs. However, gccgo faces challenges in achieving feature parity with the go compiler. It has an outdated garbage collector and experiences delays in updates. Version 1. 4 brings changes to the C runtime and the way the garbage collector expects type information. The shift from segmented to contiguous stacks also poses challenges, as current C compilers do not support the necessary precise control and use of stack knives. Despite these challenges, gccgo has seen significant improvements, becoming separate from GCC and offering greater flexibility. The implementation of LLVM has resulted in a more efficient compiler. The use of Portable Native Client allows for running native code in web browsers, leading to increased adoption of Go. Manghane emphasizes the importance of catching up with the go compiler and experimenting with features like generics. He also highlights the need to improve basic tools, particularly in authorization and book compilers. Minimizing garbage collection overhead is crucial, and stamp analysis is proposed as a method to enhance the performance of the garbage collector. The ultimate goal is to achieve a more efficient and versatile garbage collector. Additionally, the language fancy power has the potential to improve binary generation and inspire improvements in the go compiler.</p></details>

    <p><b>Summary:</b>In the GopherCon 2017 episode titled "The New Era of Go Package Management, " Sam Boyer discusses the importance of package management in software development and the transition towards official tooling. He emphasizes the need for a common language in the software ecosystem to effectively share code and improve collaboration. Boyer acknowledges the challenges of dependency management in Go programming, such as the lack of emphasis on releases and potential conflicts with the go get tool. However, he highlights the Go community's culture of caution and thoughtfulness when dealing with dependencies. Various tools, including Goep, Glide, and GB, have been developed to address reproducibility and versioning issues. The introduction of the vendor directory in 2015 improved dependency management but also introduced new challenges. To address these issues, a committee was formed, and GitHub Depp was introduced as an official experiment in dependency management. Depp relies heavily on community participation and follows a two-file system using a Toml file to declare rules and constraints. It generates a lock file for reproducibility and follows semantic versioning. Boyer also mentions Digby, a package managing gopher that aims to integrate relevant behavior into the tool chain. The development of the Go tool chain involves experimentation and mapping to ensure a clear transition. Boyer emphasizes the importance of community participation and support in the success of these tools. Overall, the Go programming language offers effective dependency management tools and owes its success to the contributions and support of the community.</p></details>

    <p><b>Summary:</b>In this episode of dotGo 2017, Sam Boyer discusses the functional design principles behind dep, a dependency management tool for Go. Despite Go not being a functional language, Boyer demonstrates how principles from functional programming can be leveraged to design efficient and effective Go programs. One key concept Boyer explores is memoization, a technique that improves the performance of functions by caching their results. He explains how memoization can be applied to the Fibonacci sequence, reducing the number of function calls and improving computation time. By storing previously computed values, the time complexity of the function is reduced to O(n). Boyer emphasizes the relevance of memoization in avoiding unnecessary work and highlights dep ensure as a key function in the code. Boyer also delves into the topic of dependency management in Go. He explains that dependency managers map project source code to its dependencies, adding metadata to describe desired sources. He discusses the two notions of 'should' for dependencies: looser constraints and stricter reproducible builds. Go uses static analysis to map project source to manifest, and the relationship between project source, manifest, and lock files is crucial. Boyer explains how the depth model analyzes import statements and uses the go package Tommo to create a lock and populate the vendor directory. Overall, Boyer emphasizes the importance of designing transparent and error-free systems with valid inputs and outputs. He suggests that exploring different programming models, such as functional programming and actor models, can lead to innovative and beneficial systems. By applying principles from functional programming, even in non-functional languages like Go, developers can create more efficient and effective programs.</p></details>
  - [discuss/go-dep](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sbrZfPgNmfw) <details><summary>Building Predictability into Your Pipeline :: Russ Cox; Jess Frazelle, Sam Boyer, Pete Garcin. Feb 22, 2018</summary>
    <p><b>Summary:</b>In the episode "Building Predictability into Your Pipeline, " Pete Garcin from ActiveState, Sam Boyer from Stripe, Russ Cox from Google, and Jess Frazelle from Microsoft discuss the challenges and solutions related to reproducible builds, environment configuration, and dependency management. Dependency management has been a long-standing problem in software development, but Go has made improvements with code hosting site import paths and the introduction of vendor directories. Tools centered around vendor directories, such as DEP, have been widely utilized in production. However, the availability of updated data on its usage is limited. The adoption of semantic versions and the need for clear documentation and user-friendly interfaces are ongoing areas of improvement. Implementing dependency management in the build pipeline has resulted in significant improvements for large projects like Kubernetes. Vigo, a new tool that provides an alternative solution for package management in Go programming, has proven to be highly efficient and capable of handling complex environments. However, the use of symlinks in Kubernetes has caused some problems. Vigo is gaining traction and being adopted by major projects. Reproducible builds ensure consistent deployment of applications, and containerization offers a solution by providing a consistent environment for application deployment. Transitioning to containers has benefits, such as easier updates and maintenance, but it requires effort to change workflows and specific tooling for integration with CI/CD processes. Optimizing container images and reducing dependencies are crucial for performance. Language package managers play a crucial role in software development, and verification steps ensure integrity. Proxy support for the system is a challenge, as companies want to ensure package stability and security. Ongoing work is being done to improve tooling and verification methods, with Microsoft's open source team involved in the development process. The adoption of Go language faces challenges due to its perception as a bleeding-edge technology. To address this, changes are being made to introduce package management and versioning, crucial for reproducible builds and compatibility. Gathering community feedback is essential before implementing these changes, and an official go proposal will soon be initiated. Overall, the experts emphasize the importance of reproducible builds, clear documentation, user-friendly interfaces, and community engagement to overcome challenges in adopting Go and ensure predictability in the software development pipeline.</p></details>

### Memory Management

#### Allocator

A quick history about the Go's memory allocator: Russ Cox first implements
the memory allocator based on `tcmalloc` for Go 1, `mcache` is cached on M.
Then he revised the allocator to allow user code to use 16GB memory and later allows 128GB.
However, the allocator (including scavenger) was suffered from massive lock contentions and
does not scale. After Dmitry's scalable runtime scheduler, the allocator can allocate directly
from P (with much less) lock contentions. In the meantime, the scavenger is migrated from
an independent thread into the system monitor thread. Now, Michael is actively working on
improving the memory allocator's scalability, such as migrating scavenger
to user threads, bitmap-based page allocator, scalable mcentral.

### image, x/image

The following issues are surrounding by the color management of the `image` standard library.
At the moment, Go's `image` library doesn't read or write meta information from an image in
the encoding or decoding phase. Therefore the color information could go wrong while processing
an image such as scaling in a non-linear sRGB space. A universal solution is to design image
metadata APIs to aware the color profile in an encoded image file.

    <p><b>Summary:</b>In this episode of Computerphile, Professor Brian Kernighan discusses the creation of the book "C" Programming Language. The book, co-written by Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie, is a comprehensive guide to the widely used programming language. Kernighan explains that the development of "C" was influenced by the MULTICS project, which aimed to create a computing utility. Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie, who were involved in MULTICS, went on to develop UNIX, a stripped-down operating system. They experimented with high-level languages and created B, a precursor to "C". "C" allowed the operating system to be rewritten in a high-level language, making it more understandable and portable across different architectures. The book, published in 1978, included mathematical expressions and tables, and went through multiple editions. Kernighan also mentions that he wrote tutorial documents on programming languages B and "C" due to market demand. He convinced Dennis Ritchie to co-write a book on "C", combining the tutorial document with Ritchie's reference manual. The book became a definitive guide to "C" and played a significant role in the language's widespread adoption.</p></details>
